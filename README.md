This is a fun project using only basic HTML, CSS, and JS since I forgot how to use them XD.

Currently it's not done yet, might add a conversation flow after user presses yes/no button and also add a little surprise in the middle of the conversation.

In next project, I will try to use TailwindCSS and ReactJS to make it more fire.
