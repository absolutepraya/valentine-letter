This is a fun project using only basic HTML, CSS, and JS since I forgot how to use them XD.

It's very simple, but I tried not to make it boring as much as I could. Go check it out!

*\*Note:*
Not available for mobile view, too lazy to make responsive page.
Also, I used relative units for almost everything, so maximized window is recommended.
